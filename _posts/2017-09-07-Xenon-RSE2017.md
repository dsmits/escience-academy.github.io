We gave a 90-minute handson tutorial on Xenon at the [RSE2017](https://rse.ac.uk/conf2017/) conference.

The focus of the tutorial was on using Xenon’s command line interface. In addition, we briefly covered Xenon’s Java, Python, and REST APIs.

The tutorial and related materials can be found [here](https://xenonrse2017.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
