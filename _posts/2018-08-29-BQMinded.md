title: BQ-Minded summer school
---
We were invited to participate in the BQ-Minded summer school, in Antwerp, Belgium. [This workshop](https://escience-academy.github.io/2018-08-29-BQMinded/) covered Unix Shell & Task Automation and Introduction to Git/GitHub from the standard Software Carpentry curriculum, plus a custom session on Scientific data analysis with Python. In this lesson we focused on model fitting and image processing.

We will soon write a blog post about this workshop.
