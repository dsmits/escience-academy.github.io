title: Xenon tutorial, Sept 2019, DTL Programmers meeting
---
We gave a 80-minute handson tutorial on Xenon at the [DTL Programmers meeting](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1D-xBb7Vqiv-qPUgL_8uze1Yx0wbBcyFSZxLSf49SGyk).

The focus of the tutorial was on using Xenon’s command line interface. In addition, we briefly covered Xenon’s Java, Python, and related tools such as Xenon-Flow.

The tutorial and related materials can be found [here](https://xenon-tutorial.readthedocs.io/en/latest/).
