title: Good practices for research with Python, Oct 2019, SURF Utrecht
---
This was the third workshop of a [New series of computational skills workshops](https://www.surf.nl/en/news/new-series-of-computational-skills-workshops). This workshop series is jointly organized by The Netherlands eScience Center and SURF. Through these workshops, the eScience center and SURF inform and inspire researchers about the use of best practices in scientific software development as well as efficient use of cutting-edge computing systems.

The simplicity and programability features of Python have turned this programming language into a very handy tool for everyday research. This [workshop](https://sara-nl.github.io/2019-10-01-GoodPracticesPython/) provided an all-in-one starter package to develop you own research project from scratch using Python.
